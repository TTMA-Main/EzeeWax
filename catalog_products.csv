Contamination naturally accumulates on the interior glass faster than you may think. Dirt and grime can stick to the micropores of your glass and once it bonds to the glass, this contamination can be a pain to remove. With G6, Gtechniq skipped any ingredients that could cause smearing or hazing during the cleaning process (i.e. fragrance, cheap recovered solvents, etc.). The quality cleaning agents will instead, encapsulate nasty dirt and grime buildups and lubricate the surface, allowing you to safely and easily remove contamination. On top of those streak-free cleaning features, G6 also creates a positive charge on the glass, making it antistatic. This helps the product repel dust, keeping your glass cleaning less frequent.

Durability tests prove that after 600 washes, water still beads on surfaces treated with EXO. Hybrid coating technology gives automobiles, aircraft, boats, and RV's unbeatable protection from the elements.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The science behind EXO is amazing! It contains an organic element and an inorganic element, which both have a UV filter. The inorganic element forms a strong chemical bond with the substrate to which EXO is applied. The organic element provides the functional dirt and water repellency that you can see with your own eyes.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>More remarkable water beads on EXO-treated surfaces in almost spherical drops. Looking like pearls sitting on your vehicles finish. Water beads roll off leaving a spot-free vehicle. EXO produces a hard-as-nails, glass-like shine on all colors.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>When you use EXO durability is measured in years, not weeks. EXO remains hydrophobic after years of regular washing and 2 years of sun exposure.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EXO isn't all about protection. It also gives surfaces a high gloss and a slick feel like the best car wax. The best part is that the EXO finish will remain slick and shiny for much longer than any traditional wax or paint sealant. Enjoy years of surface protection with just one application!</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Directions:</strong></p><p><strong>EXO needs to be applied to surfaces that are free of contaminants and defects. Clay vehicle to remove surface contaminants. If needed machine polish to remove swirls, scratches, water spots, and anything that hinders the shine.</strong></p><p><strong>After polishing and defects are removed, chemically strip the paint using GTechniq Panel Wipe. This will remove any polishing oils so EXO can bond to the surface.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Working on one panel at a time, apply EXO directly onto a clean microfiber towel. From testing we’ve found a towel with a flat weave or short nap to work best.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Evenly distribute product using minimal pressure. Go over each section 2-3 times to ensure even coverage.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Immediately buff off residue using a clean, dry microfiber towel. It is important to immediately buff the area that EXO was applied to.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Apply a second coat of EXO twenty minutes after first coat ensuring complete coverage. Avoid getting vehicle wet for 48 hours.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Maintain and protection using GTechniq W1 G-Wash and C1.5 Silo Seal.</strong></p>",088a11_de1ea117cae94515b17d7006dcb54325~mv2.jpg;088a11_0255ad39558d46e69c665c48f6c585b9~mv2.jpg;088a11_e0e3903af9b4402cbe770dc0c077c0a3~mv2.jpg;c0abaa_364a5cde7fa74f2abb4c1b5f6806aa2a~mv2.jpg,GTechniq,,,63.5,,true,PERCENT,0.0,0,0.0,Size,DROP_DOWN,30ML $63.50;50ML $92.50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GTechniq

Use lint-free applicator pads to spread on Wheel Armor. Because the coating forms its bond immediately, it is very important you remove excess coating from the treated surface and any that has gone onto your car’s bodywork or glass as soon as possible. To remove residue, you should use a microfiber cloth and use a light touch, i.e. not like buffing a wax but more like using a chamois on your car.

This unique design also makes for a rugged pad that can withstand extended polishing sessions.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><br><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The pad has a diameter of 7.5 inches but the thick pile gives it an overall diameter of 8 inches.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span> The Buff &amp; Shine Wool Cutting Pad is intended for severe swirls, scratches and heavy oxidation. Because this is a more aggressive pad, you’ll want a compound to get the best results.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br><br><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>A note about fluffing a wool pad:&nbsp; Wool pads are known to cake up but it’s an easy fix.&nbsp; With the polisher turned off, lay it down on the ground with the pad facing up. Set the speed to the lowest setting and turn it on. Hold a </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>pad spur</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span> against the pad as it turns. The pile will fluff up in just a few seconds.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br><br><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Your other option is to have 3 or 4 wool pads on hand so you can simply switch pads when one becomes caked.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>",088a11_6fec3afe36104c4ea4781c78160dd800~mv2.jpg;088a11_a00cd32bdf5f4aedaf278b32b7b542d3~mv2_d_1600_1200_s_2.jpg;088a11_ec3285c0d6f644d9a382fd9f3be0a496~mv2_d_1200_1600_s_2.jpg,"Buff and Shine 3"" to 8"" Wool Pads;Wool Pads 7.5 Inch",753RB,,15.1,,true,PERCENT,0.0,InStock,0.0,Quantity,DROP_DOWN,Buy 1 for $15.10;Buy 3 for $14.45 ea;Buy 6 for $13.75 ea;Buy 12 for $12.50 ea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Specifications:,"<ul>
